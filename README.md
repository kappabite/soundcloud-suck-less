====================

A super hacky userscript to temporarly fix the soundcloud website until they finally do it themselves. 

### Before
The player is on the bottom (seriously, that's almost unusable) and the statusbar just looks horrible.

### After
The player is back on the top again where it belongs and a flat look has been applied to most of the items. Also the name has been collapsed again and it just looks a lot more professional and elegant overall.
