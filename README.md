soundcloud-suck-less
====================

A userscript giving the soundcloud website a more usable and polished looking user interface (Doesn't work anymore, some things I did are now official, some are even worse now. I kind of just use Spotify now even though it's more commercial, Soundcloud is trying to do the same thing anyway). 

## Installation

First you need to [install Greasemonkey from the Firefox addon registry](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/). 
Then [just click this link](https://github.com/netsurfer912/soundcloud-suck-less/raw/master/sc-suck-less.user.js) and a dialog should appear asking whether you want to install the userscript (why else would you be reading this). 
**Holy shit, that was easy**! Just [go visit Soundcloud.com](http://soundcloud.com/) or reload a current tab and you should see the mess cleaned up and ask yourself why you haven't done this earlier. 

The same procedure should work perfectly with [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en), although I haven't tested it.
